# go-alfred-prs

A Golang port of [GitHub PR workflow][1] for [Alfred][2].

**[DOWNLOAD][3]**

This workflow is powered by **[AwGo][4]** and **[go-github][5]**.

The original GitHub PR workflow was developed in Python 2 which reached its end-of-life on Jan 1st, 2020.

And to add to that, Apple no longer bundles Python 2 in macOS since macOS 12.3 Monterey.

## Workflow Features
* shows you all relevant pull requests (the ones you want to see anyway)
* optionally displays ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for each pull request that was reviewed
* securely stores your GitHub API token in the system keychain
* works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise
* fast, lightweight, no extra runtime dependencies - just what you'd expect from a Go application

## Commands
* **`ghpr`** - display your pull requests
* **`ghpr-update`** - manually refresh the list of PRs
* **`ghpr-host`** - set a custom GitHub URL
* **`ghpr-auth`** - set your GitHub API token

## Workflow Environment Variables
Variable                | Default      | Description
----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------
**`CACHE_AGE_SECONDS`** | `600`        | TTL for internal cache of pull requests
**`CHECK_FOR_UPDATES`** | `true`       | flag to enable checking for workflow updates
**`GIT_BASE_URL`**      | `github.com` | url of the GitHub instance
**`QUERY_BY_ROLES`**    | `-assignee,-author,+involves,-mentions,-review-requested` | filter for the displayed pull requests<br />(the selections can be toggled by using<br />`+` or `-` prefixes in front of each role)
**`SHOW_REVIEWS`**      | `false`      | flag to enable displaying PR reviews

## Release process
A new release is automatically published by GitHub Actions when the change to the workflow [version](version) is detected.

At the moment, the workflow binary is built for `amd64` architecture only.

<details>
<summary>Why `amd64` only?</summary>

While it is possible to compile the workflow for `amd64` and `arm64`, and merge the two into a universal binary, - doing so would double the size of the executable.

And anyway, Mac computers with Apple silicon can run `amd64` executables seamlessly using [Rosetta][6].

To install Rosetta for the first time on a Mac with Apple silicon, run the command below:

    $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
